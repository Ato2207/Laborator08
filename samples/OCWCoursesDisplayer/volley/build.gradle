// NOTE: The only changes that belong in this file are the definitions
// of tool versions (gradle plugin, implementation SDK, build tools), so that
// Volley can be built via gradle as a standalone project.
//
// Any other changes to the build config belong in rules.gradle, which
// is used by projects that depend on Volley but define their own
// tools versions across all dependencies to ensure a consistent build.
//
// Most users should just add this line to settings.gradle:
//     include(":volley")
//
// If you have a more complicated Gradle setup you can choose to use
// this instead:
//     include(":volley")
//     project(':volley').buildFileName = 'rules.gradle'

// Use root project's buildscript and repositories
